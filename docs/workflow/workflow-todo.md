# Workflow API Implementation Progress Tracker

This document tracks the implementation progress of the Workflow API based on the workflow-plan.md.

## Implementation Progress

### Step 0: Analyze and Plan Legacy Code Migration
- [ ] **Analysis**: Examine current workflow implementation structure
- [ ] **Migration Planning**: Create detailed migration steps for legacy code consolidation

### Step 1: Create Workflow Types and Base Models
- [ ] **Implementation**: Create workflow types definition and core data models
- [ ] **Testing**: Create comprehensive tests for workflow types and base models

### Step 2: Implement Run Workflow API Models
- [ ] **Implementation**: Implement Run Workflow API request, request body, and response models
- [ ] **Testing**: Create tests for Run Workflow API models

### Step 3: Implement Get Workflow Run Detail API Models
- [ ] **Implementation**: Implement Get Workflow Run Detail API models
- [ ] **Testing**: Create tests for Get Workflow Run Detail API models

### Step 4: Implement Stop Workflow API Models
- [ ] **Implementation**: Implement Stop Workflow API models
- [ ] **Testing**: Create tests for Stop Workflow API models

### Step 5: Implement Upload File API Models
- [ ] **Implementation**: Implement Upload File API models with multipart/form-data support
- [ ] **Testing**: Create tests for Upload File API models

### Step 6: Implement Workflow Logs API Models
- [ ] **Implementation**: Implement Get Workflow Logs API models
- [ ] **Testing**: Create tests for Workflow Logs API models

### Step 7: Implement Application Info API Models
- [ ] **Implementation**: Implement Application Information API models (info, parameters, site)
- [ ] **Testing**: Create tests for Application Info API models

### Step 8: Migrate and Consolidate Workflow Resource Classes
- [ ] **Migration**: Migrate existing resource classes into single consolidated Workflow resource
- [ ] **Implementation**: Implement consolidated Workflow resource class with all migrated functionality
- [ ] **Testing**: Create comprehensive tests for the Workflow resource class

### Step 9: Migrate Version Integration and Clean Up
- [ ] **Migration**: Migrate version integration from multi-resource to single-resource structure
- [ ] **Implementation**: Implement consolidated version integration and perform cleanup
- [ ] **Testing**: Create integration tests for migrated version and service integration

### Step 10: Create Workflow Examples
- [ ] **Implementation**: Create comprehensive examples for all workflow APIs
- [ ] **Testing**: Create validation tests for all workflow examples

### Step 11: Comprehensive Testing and Migration Validation
- [ ] **Implementation**: Perform comprehensive testing including migration validation
- [ ] **Testing**: Create final comprehensive integration tests including migration validation

### Step 12: Documentation and Final Validation
- [ ] **Implementation**: Complete documentation and perform final validation
- [ ] **Testing**: Perform final validation and acceptance testing

## Overall Progress

**Total Steps**: 12 (24 sub-tasks)
**Completed**: 0
**In Progress**: 0
**Remaining**: 24

**Progress**: 0% (0/24)

## Notes

- Each step includes both implementation and testing phases
- Migration steps (0, 8, 9, 11) require special attention to legacy code
- All tests must pass before proceeding to next step
- Final validation ensures migration completeness and backward compatibility
